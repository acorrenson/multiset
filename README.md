# multiset

This repository contains a tiny proof that the multiset extension of a wellfounded relation is well founded.
This result is essential to prove the termination of some algorithms.
While many formal proofs of this result exist, ours is less than two hundred
lines of pure Coq and does not rely on any dependencies.
