# multiset

This repository contains a tiny proof that the multiset extension of a well founded relation is well founded.
Such a result is extremely useful to prove termination of complex algorithms.
While this proof can be found in multiple large projects, our proof is just two hundred lines of pure Coq and can be used without having to load any dependencies.

Our proof closely follows the one of the paper [Coq formalization of the higher-order recursive path ordering](https://rdcu.be/c96SY)
